# Soccer World Cup Qatar 2022 Predictions

Welcome to the Soccer World Cup Qatar 2022 Predictions project repository! This project aims to develop an advanced artificial intelligence model using the Naive Bayes algorithm to predict the outcomes of the highly anticipated World Cup matches based on historical data.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to leverage the power of machine learning and data analysis to accurately forecast the results of the exciting matches that will take place during the Soccer World Cup in Qatar in 2022. By utilizing historical data and training our model with the Naive Bayes algorithm, we aim to provide reliable predictions and insights into the tournament.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `data/`: This directory contains the data files used for training and testing the prediction model.
- `Extracting_data.py`: In this Python file are the code used to extract the data.
- `Cleaning_Data.ipynb`: Here, you can find the Jupyter notebook that showcase the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation processes.
- `Soccer_World_Championship.ipynb`: Here, you can find the Jupiter notebook where is the model and the predictions of the cup.
- `README.md`: You are here! This document provides an overview of the project and its structure.
